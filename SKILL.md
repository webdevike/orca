name: orca
description: 🐋 Workflow-agnostic multi-pane orchestrator. Spawns and coordinates worker sessions in cmux or tmux panes via pluggable playbooks. Use when the user invokes /orca, asks to "orchestrate", "manage workstreams in parallel", "run multiple agents/omp sessions", or wants something to keep multiple omp (or Claude Code / codex) worker sessions advancing without manual juggling (e.g. running GSD phases to completion). Primary runtime is omp. Picks a backend at runtime (cmux if available, else tmux), reads playbooks from .orca/playbooks/ (project) or ~/.orca/playbooks/ (global) or its bundled defaults, and drives workers via spawn/send/read primitives. Orca NEVER writes project code; it only delegates to worker panes.

# 🐋 orca

Workflow-agnostic multi-pane orchestrator. Spawns workers in cmux or tmux panes, applies a **playbook** that defines the workflow, monitors progress, escalates when stuck. Primary runtime is **omp** (`@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`, the `omp` binary; orca's schema calls this agent `pi`); Claude Code and codex are supported alternatives.

## Core Constraint

**Orca never writes project code.** No Edit/Write/Bash on project files outside `.orca/`. If a task requires touching code, spawn a worker pane and delegate. The intelligence lives in playbooks — orca is just the muxer + dispatcher.

## On Invocation

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `/orca` | Read `.orca/state.json` if present; otherwise enter planning mode (ask what to orchestrate) |
| `/orca <playbook> key=value …` | Apply named playbook with args (skip planning) |
| `/orca status` | Capture-pane each tracked worker, summarize signals |
| `/orca stop <pane-ref>` | Close one worker pane, update state |
| `/orca kill` | Close all orca-managed panes, clear state |
| `/orca --voice` (or `/orca --voice on`) | Enable voice I/O for the current orca pane (see [Voice mode](#voice-mode-orca---voice)). After processing the flag, continue with whatever else was on the command line — `/orca --voice` alone behaves like `/orca`; `/orca --voice gsd phase=2` applies the playbook. |
| `/orca --voice off` | Disable voice I/O (unregister the orca pane; daemon keeps running so other tools can speak). |

## Backend Detection (first thing every run)

```bash
if cmux current-window >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ORCA_BACKEND=cmux
elif [[ -n "${TMUX:-}" ]]; then
  ORCA_BACKEND=tmux
else
  echo "🐋 orca needs cmux or tmux. Launch tmux (tmux new -s orca) or open cmux, then re-run."
  exit 1
fi
```

Save the chosen backend to `.orca/state.json` so subsequent ticks don't re-probe. See [references/backends.md](./references/backends.md) for the full primitive table — every other section in this skill assumes you've selected one.

## Playbooks

A playbook is a YAML-frontmatter markdown file telling orca how to drive a particular kind of worker (GSD phases, codex agentic loop, dev server, etc.).

**Lookup precedence** (first match wins on name conflict):
1. `./.orca/playbooks/*.md` — project-local
2. `~/.orca/playbooks/*.md` — user global
3. `~/.claude/skills/orca/playbooks/*.md` — bundled defaults

**Frontmatter shape** (full spec in [references/playbook-format.md](./references/playbook-format.md); worked example in [`playbooks/gsd.md`](./playbooks/gsd.md)):

```yaml
---
name: gsd
description: GSD multi-repo phase orchestration
triggers: ["gsd", "run phase"]
params:
  - name: repo
    required: true
  - name: phase
    required: true
supported_agents: [claude-code]            # which agents can run this playbook as workers
default_agent: claude-code

      initial: "/clear && /gsd:plan-phase {phase}"
    codex:
      launcher: codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
      initial: "Read .planning/STATE.md and execute phase {phase}'s plan…"
    pi:
      launcher: pi                         # pi has no permission prompts by default
      initial: "Read .planning/STATE.md and execute phase {phase}…"
watch:
  - pattern: "PHASE N COMPLETE ✓"
    action: advance
  - pattern: "Do you want to make this edit?"
    action: send_enter
stop_when:
  - "MILESTONE COMPLETE"
---
```

A playbook describes the **work** in an agent-agnostic way. Each entry under `spawn.agents` is the launcher + initial-prompt mapping for one agent runtime. `supported_agents` declares which are actually viable (e.g., GSD is Claude-Code-only because the `/gsd:*` commands are Claude Code skills). The orchestrator picks an agent per worker — defaulting to `default_agent`, overridable per-spawn.

The markdown body holds free-form notes orca reads as natural-language guidance (quirks, escalation hints, manual recovery steps).

## Agents as orchestrator OR worker

Coding agents (**omp**/`pi`, Claude Code, codex) are interchangeable runtimes. Any of them can run **as orchestrator** (executing this skill / its peer configs) or **as worker** (spawned by an orchestrator, executing a playbook). omp is the primary runtime here. This SKILL.md IS omp's orchestrator config. The orca repo ships peer configs so the other agents can play the role too:

| Agent | Orchestrator config | Lives at |
|-------|--------------------|----------|
| omp (`pi`) | `SKILL.md` (this file), omp reads it directly; `pi/README.md` covers omp-worker specifics | `~/.claude/skills/orca/SKILL.md` (omp discovers it via its `claude` skill provider, priority 80) |
| Claude Code | `SKILL.md` (this file) | `~/.claude/skills/orca/SKILL.md` |
| codex | `AGENTS.md` (codex's project-config convention) | repo root, codex picks it up automatically when launched in the dir |

A worker pane only ever runs an agent in single-agent mode — the orchestration skill is irrelevant there. Workers consume the **playbook**, not orca itself.

## Auto-permission Mode

Workers must launch in an unattended (non-prompting) mode, so orca cannot babysit interactive permission prompts. **omp needs no bypass flag: its default `approvalMode` is `yolo`** (auto-approves read/write/exec), and subagents always run headless yolo. Claude Code and codex each need their explicit bypass flag.

| Tool | Auto launcher |
|------|---------------|
| omp (`pi`) | `omp`: default `approvalMode: yolo` already auto-approves everything, no flag needed. Force with `--yolo` / `--auto-approve` if the user's global config lowered it to `write`/`always-ask`. |
| Claude Code | `cdp` (skip-permissions wrapper) |
| codex | `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (or current full-auto flag) |
| Other agentic CLIs | their equivalent unattended flag |

A playbook may set `launcher_mode: safe` to opt out, but this is rare — the user has already accepted the safety tradeoff for orchestration ergonomics.

## Delegate perception to subagents

Orca's main context fills fast with **raw pane outputs, file dumps, log tails** — high tokens, low information. Each `cmux read-screen` lands 500–2000 tokens of mostly-noise; each `git show` on a sprawling commit is similar; multi-kilobyte worker briefs land verbatim in context when written from the main thread. Across many ticks this dominates context spend even though orca itself does coordination, not analysis.

**Fix**: route perception-heavy reads through Claude Code's `Agent` tool. The subagent has its own ~200K context window and only its **final response** returns to orca's main context. A 1500-token pane capture becomes an 80-token "still executing, last action: edit foo.ts" — ~20:1 reduction on the perception layer.

### When to delegate

- **Polling worker panes** — read the surface, return a 2-line status (signal + last action). Per-tick savings compound across many workers and many ticks.
- **Reading large state files** — `.orca/state.json` past ~5KB; `.orca/log.md` past a few sessions. Subagent extracts the specific fields/sessions you asked about.
- **Reading dev-server / pane logs** — tails are mostly HMR + access-log noise. Subagent grep-and-summarizes errors / warnings / 401–500 responses.
- **Drafting worker briefs** — multi-kilobyte briefs are wasteful in main context. Subagent writes the brief to `.orca/logs/brief-<id>.md` and returns just the file path.
- **Reading screenshots** — visual context is heavy. Subagent describes the image in 2–3 lines.
- **Inspecting big git diffs** — `git show <sha>` on a sprawling commit; subagent extracts what changed at the file/intent level.

### When NOT to delegate

- **Spawning workers** — `cmux new-split` is a single tool call returning one OK line. Round-trip cost > savings.
- **Sending text to a known pane** — single `cmux send`; cheap and the result is empty.
- **`state.json` updates** — `Edit` is bounded and the diff is small.
- **Cases where the result IS the next decision input** — e.g., "is worker_id X still active?" The subagent overhead exceeds the savings; just `Read` and decide.

### How (concrete patterns)

**Poll subagent** — replaces a direct `cmux read-screen` in Step 5:

```
Agent({
  description: "Poll worker",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: "Run `cmux read-screen --surface surface:N --lines 25` and return: (1) one-line current status, (2) any errors visible, (3) whether IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE or IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKED appears in the output. Don't return the full pane text."
})
```

**Brief-drafting subagent** — replaces composing a multi-kilobyte brief inline before sending it to a worker:

```
Agent({
  description: "Draft worker brief",
  prompt: "Write a brief at `.orca/logs/brief-<worker_id>.md` following references/worker-brief-template.md. Scope: <one-line>. Params: <key=value …>. Return only the absolute path of the file you wrote."
})
```

**Log-analysis subagent** — replaces tailing a noisy server log:

```
Agent({
  description: "Tail server log",
  prompt: "Read /tmp/wha-flo-dev.log lines 1-500. Return: errors (with line numbers), warnings, any 401/500 responses, and a 2-line summary. Skip routine HMR + access-log noise."
})
```
**omp orchestrator:** use the `task` tool (or an `eval` `agent()` thunk) in place of `Agent({…})`, same prompt, same 2-line return contract. omp subagents run headless (`approvalMode: yolo`) with their own context window, so the perception savings are identical.


### Token math

- Direct pane poll: ~1500 tokens of raw output enter orca context.
- Subagent poll: ~80 tokens (request + 2-line return) enter orca context.
- ~20:1 reduction on the perception layer. Across ~20 ticks per session and N workers, this is the difference between "session ran out of context" and "session kept going."

### Coordination implications

- **Subagents are synchronous** — orca waits for the result before continuing the same turn. That's fine; coordination doesn't need parallelism, just lean reads.
- **Results aren't ground truth indefinitely** — re-poll between substantial state changes. Don't cache a subagent's "no errors visible" across many ticks.
- **Don't chain subagents from subagents** — flatten. Each delegation should hit a single perception target and return.

## Orchestrator context budget & handoff

A long autonomous run (many phases, many ticks) eventually fills the orchestrator's OWN context, not just the workers'. Orca is built to survive this: orchestration state lives on disk (`.orca/state.json` + `.orca/log.md`), perception is delegated (above), and a fresh orchestrator session can read the state and continue. Three layers, in order of preference:

1. **Stay lean by construction.** Delegate every pane read / large-file read / brief draft to a subagent (see "Delegate perception"). Keep durable facts in `state.json` + `log.md`, never only in context. This alone pushes the ceiling far out.

2. **Let omp compact.** Under omp the orchestrator gets built-in automatic context compaction (`omp://compaction.md`); older turns summarized in place, no action needed. Extends runway for free.

3. **Self-monitor, then hand off.** omp writes its own live context occupancy every turn into its session JSONL as `contextSnapshot.promptTokens` (each turn resends the whole context, so this is exact, not a proxy; `nonMessageTokens` is the fixed system+tools floor). Read it periodically:

   ```bash
   # current orchestrator context occupancy (tokens); cwd-slug session file
   slug=$(echo "$PWD" | sed 's#/#-#g')
   sess=$(ls -t ~/.omp/agent/sessions/"$slug"/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   grep -o '"promptTokens":[0-9]*' "$sess" | tail -1 | cut -d: -f2
   ```

   When occupancy crosses ~75% of the model's window, **hand off**: flush `state.json` + a `## Handoff` note in `log.md` (live worker surface refs, phase, next action), then spawn a fresh orchestrator session (new tab / `/loop` rewake) that reads `state.json` and resumes. GSD is sequential, so there is at most ONE live worker to reattach to and its surface ref is already in `state.json`, so handoff is a non-event.

Claude Code / codex orchestrators lack `promptTokens` introspection; there, rely on layers 1–2 and hand off on the harness's own context warning.

## Signal channel

The default way orca learns a worker's state is **structured events**, not screen-scraping. Each worker appends JSON lines to `.orca/signals/<worker_id>.jsonl`; orca tails that file. This is event-driven, immune to ANSI/redraw noise, and doesn't depend on the model printing a banner string verbatim. Screen-scraping (`watch[]` + `poll.sh` capture) survives as the fallback for workers that emit nothing.

**Two emitters, one file:**
- **`orca-signal <event> [k=v …]`** (`scripts/orca-signal`) — the worker calls this at semantic milestones, driven by the playbook prompt (`phase_complete`, `done`, `blocked`, …). No-op when `$ORCA_SIGNAL_FILE` is unset, so prompts are safe off-orca.
- **`orca-worker-signal.ts`** (`hooks/`) — an omp hook orca loads with `--hook` at spawn. Emits automatic `heartbeat` (turn_end), `idle` (agent_end), `session_end` (shutdown). Liveness with zero prompt burden. Claude Code / codex workers get semantics from the helper but no auto-heartbeat.

**Wiring (Step 4b):** orca exports `ORCA_WORKER_ID` + `ORCA_SIGNAL_FILE` into the launcher and appends `--hook` for omp. The file path is absolute and orchestrator-side (`<orca-cwd>/.orca/signals/<id>.jsonl`) because the worker's cwd is its own repo.

**Reading (Step 5):** `scripts/read-signal.sh <worker_id>` returns the latest semantic event, its fields, and `heartbeat_age_s`. orca matches the event against the playbook's `events[]` rules (see [playbook-format.md](./references/playbook-format.md#events-signal-channel)) and runs the same action vocabulary as `watch[]`. `heartbeat_age_s > stuck_threshold_s` trips a **watchdog** — the liveness check screen-scraping never had (a hung-but-present pane looked identical to a working one).

**Playbook authoring:** declare `events[]` for the structured path and keep `watch[]` as a safety net; instruct the worker in `initial`/`next` to emit milestones via `orca-signal`. Full schema + emit conventions in [playbook-format.md](./references/playbook-format.md). Event format + state fields in [state-schema.md](./references/state-schema.md).

## Procedure

Follow these steps in order on every `/orca` invocation. Numbered steps are prescriptive — do them, in this order, every time.

### Step 1. Detect or read backend

```bash
if [[ -f .orca/state.json ]]; then
  BACKEND=$(jq -r '.backend' .orca/state.json)
else
  if cmux current-window >/dev/null 2>&1; then BACKEND=cmux
  elif [[ -n "${TMUX:-}" ]]; then BACKEND=tmux
  else echo "🐋 needs cmux or tmux. Launch one and re-run."; exit 1
  fi
fi
```

Persist `BACKEND` to `state.json` on first run. Never re-detect once persisted.

### Step 2. Load or initialize state

If `.orca/state.json` exists, parse it and reconcile:
- For each `worker`, capture the pane (`cmux read-screen --surface <ref> --lines 30` or `tmux capture-pane -t <ref> -p -S -30`).
- If capture fails, mark `last_signal: dead`. GC dead workers on next tick.

If absent, create `.orca/` directory and write a fresh `state.json` skeleton (workers: [], questions_pending: [], backend, started_at, cwd) — see [references/state-schema.md](./references/state-schema.md).

### Step 3. Route by user input

| User input | Route |
|------------|-------|
| `/orca` (no args) | Step 4a: planning mode |
| `/orca <name> key=value …` | Step 4b: apply playbook directly |
| `/orca status` | Step 5: report and exit |
| `/orca stop <worker_id>` | Step 6 (close one), then exit |
| `/orca kill` | Step 6 (close all), then exit |
| `/orca` arrives via `/loop` rewake | Step 5: poll + advance, then re-schedule |

**Strip flags before routing.** If `--voice` (or `--voice on` / `--voice off`) is present anywhere in the args, run the voice-mode handler from the [Voice mode](#voice-mode-orca---voice) section *first*, then strip the flag and re-evaluate the remaining args against this table (so `/orca --voice` alone routes to Step 4a; `/orca --voice gsd phase=2` routes to Step 4b).

### Step 4a. Planning mode

1. List available playbooks (scan `./.orca/playbooks/`, then `~/.orca/playbooks/`, then bundled `playbooks/`).
2. Ask the user what to orchestrate. Match their answer against playbook `triggers` if possible. Otherwise treat as freeform — offer to write a PRD to `.orca/prd-<slug>.md` and proceed without a playbook (manual `watch` rules from the user, captured into a one-off in-memory playbook).
3. Once a playbook is selected, gather any missing required `params` (prompt for each).
4. Confirm the plan back to the user (one line: "spawning {playbook} for {params} as {agent} worker"). Wait for ack before spawning.
5. Proceed to Step 4b.

### Step 4b. Apply playbook (spawn worker)

> **Ref format gotcha (cmux)**: every `--surface` / `--workspace` flag below expects the **full ref** (`surface:N`, `workspace:M`) — exactly as `cmux new-split` returns it on the `OK …` line. A bare numeric (`--surface 36`) is parsed as a *positional index*, not an ID, and fails with `Error: Surface index not found` on virtually every call. Capture the ref string verbatim and pass it through unchanged. Wrong: `cmux send --surface 36 …`. Right: `cmux send --surface surface:36 …`. (See [references/backends.md](./references/backends.md#primitive-table) for the full callout.)

For each worker the playbook implies (usually one — but cross-repo playbooks may declare more):

1. Resolve params (user input + playbook defaults). If any required param is missing, error and exit.
2. Pick agent: explicit `agent=` arg → playbook's `default_agent` → first `supported_agents` entry. Verify the agent block exists in `spawn.agents.<name>`.
3. Generate a `worker_id` (`{playbook}-{cwd-slug}-{disambiguator}`). Derive its signal-channel path: `SIGFILE="$(pwd)/.orca/signals/<worker_id>.jsonl"` (absolute — `.orca/` lives in the orchestrator's cwd, which the worker never shares).
4. Spawn the pane:
   - **cmux**: `cmux new-split <direction>` (default `right`); capture `surface:N` and `workspace:M` from stdout (`OK surface:N workspace:M`). **Note**: `cmux new-split` does NOT honor `spawn.cwd` — the new pane inherits the orchestrator's cwd. If the playbook sets a different `spawn.cwd`, you must `cd` into it as part of the launcher (see step 6).
   - **tmux**: `tmux new-window -d -n "<worker_id>" -c "<spawn.cwd>"`. tmux honors `-c` directly, no extra cd needed.
5. Sleep `spawn.agents.<agent>.initial_wait_s || 5` seconds.
6. **Send the launcher**, with cwd compensation for cmux AND signal-channel wiring. The launcher gets two env vars prepended and (for omp workers) the worker-signal hook appended:
   - Env: `ORCA_WORKER_ID='<worker_id>' ORCA_SIGNAL_FILE='<SIGFILE>'` — exported to the worker so `orca-signal` and the hook know where to write.
   - omp hook: append `--hook '<orca-repo>/hooks/orca-worker-signal.ts'` to the `omp` launcher for automatic heartbeat/idle/session_end events. (`<orca-repo>` = the orca skill checkout, e.g. `~/.claude/skills/orca`.) Claude Code / codex don't load this hook — they rely on prompt-emitted `orca-signal` calls only.
   - **cmux + spawn.cwd != orchestrator's cwd**: send `cd '<spawn.cwd>' && ORCA_WORKER_ID='…' ORCA_SIGNAL_FILE='…' <launcher> [--hook …]`.
   - **cmux + spawn.cwd == orchestrator's cwd**: send `ORCA_WORKER_ID='…' ORCA_SIGNAL_FILE='…' <launcher> [--hook …]` directly.
   - **tmux**: same env-prefixed launcher (cwd was set at window creation via `-c`).

   The launcher must be the unattended variant: `omp` (default `yolo`, no flag), `cdp` for Claude Code, `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for codex. Submit with `cmux send-key … enter` or `tmux send-keys … Enter`. Also ensure `<orca-repo>/scripts` is on the worker's `PATH` (the playbook prompt calls bare `orca-signal`) — either symlinked into a PATH dir by `install.sh`, or reference it absolutely in the prompt.
7. Sleep ~8s (Claude Code / codex boot time).
8. **Handle first-run trust prompt**. Both Claude Code and codex show a trust dialog the first time an agent boots in an unfamiliar directory. Capture the pane and send a single Enter (which selects the highlighted "trust / continue" option) if you see any of:
   - Claude Code: `Is this a project you trust?` / `Yes, I trust this folder`
   - codex: `Do you trust the contents of this directory?` / `Yes, continue`
   - omp (`pi`): no trust prompt, skip (omp trusts its launch cwd)

   After sending Enter, sleep 2s. If no prompt was shown, the directory is already trusted and Enter on an empty input line is harmless.
9. Send the playbook's `spawn.agents.<agent>.initial` (with param substitution applied) + Enter.

   > **Prefer subagent brief-drafting.** When the `initial` payload is a substantial brief (say, more than ~50 lines), delegate the drafting to an `Agent` subagent that writes the brief to `.orca/logs/brief-<worker_id>.md` and returns just the path — then send that file's contents (or a `cat <path>` reference) to the worker. Keeps the kilobytes of brief text out of orca's main context. See "Delegate perception to subagents" above.

10. Append the worker to `state.json` with `last_signal: spawning`. Persist:
    - `playbook` — the playbook's `name` field
    - `category` — the playbook's `category` field (default `implementation` if unset)
    - `cwd` — the resolved `spawn.cwd` after parameter substitution (canonical worktree identifier; used by Step 6 review-chain matching regardless of which param name the playbook used: `repo`, `worktree`, `target`, etc.)
    - `signal_file` — the `<SIGFILE>` path from substep 3 (or `null` if the worker isn't signal-wired). Initialize `last_event`, `last_event_at`, `last_heartbeat_at` to `null`.

    Step 6 reads `playbook`/`category`/`cwd` when deciding whether to offer the review chain and how to glob review files. Step 5 reads `signal_file` to decide signal-channel vs screen-scrape.

### Step 5. Poll + advance (every active tick)

> **Prefer subagent polling.** For each worker, instead of `cmux read-screen` directly from orca's main thread, delegate to an `Agent` subagent that runs the capture and returns just the status signals (1–3 lines). Raw pane text never enters orca's context. See "Delegate perception to subagents" above.

For each worker in `state.json` whose `last_signal` is not `task_complete` or `dead`:

**Signal-channel path (preferred — worker has a `signal_file`).** Skip pane capture entirely:

  a. Run `scripts/read-signal.sh <worker_id>` (exit 3 → no events yet; treat as `executing`, or fall through to screen-scrape if the worker is also `watch`-capable). Parse `last_event`, `last_event_at`, `heartbeat_age_s`.
  b. **Watchdog first.** If `heartbeat_age_s` > `stuck_threshold_s` (default 600): set `last_signal: stuck`, `escalate` (capture pane to `.orca/logs/`, add to `questions_pending`, ping user). Skip the rest this tick.
  c. If `last_event` is newer than the worker's stored `last_event_at` (i.e. an unprocessed event), match it against the playbook's `events[]` rules **in order** — compare `on` to `last_event` and every `where` pair to the event's fields. First match wins; run its `action` from the table below (`{event.<field>}` substitution available in `next`). A `session_end` event with no prior `done` → `dead`.
  d. Update `last_event_at`/`last_heartbeat_at`, append `history`, persist. Done — no ANSI parsing, no `stop_when`/`watch` for this worker.

**Screen-scrape fallback path (worker has no `signal_file`).** The original flow:

1. Capture pane (last `LINES` lines, default 30): `cmux read-screen --surface <ref> --lines 30` or `tmux capture-pane -t <ref> -p -S -30`. If capture fails twice in a row, mark `dead` and skip.
2. **Check `stop_when[]` first** (priority over `watch[]`). For each regex in the playbook's `stop_when` list: if it matches the captured text, mark the worker `last_signal: task_complete` and skip directly to step 6 (history append) — do NOT run watch[] matching or generic detection (terminal conditions trump in-flight actions). If `stop_when` is absent or no patterns match, continue.
3. Match each `watch[].pattern` against the captured text **in order**. First match wins.
4. On first match, perform the corresponding `action`:

   | Action | Implementation |
   |--------|---------------|
   | `advance` | Send `/clear`, sleep 2s, send substituted `next` + Enter. Set `last_signal: phase_complete`. |
   | `send_enter` | Send Enter only. `last_signal: waiting_input`. |
   | `send_text` | Send substituted `next` + Enter. |
   | `clear_and_send` | Send `/clear`, sleep 2s, send `next` + Enter. |
   | `stop` | Mark `last_signal: task_complete`. Pane will be closed in Step 6. |
   | `escalate` | Capture last 100 lines to `.orca/logs/<worker_id>-<ts>.txt`, add to `questions_pending`, ping user, no further action this tick. |
   | `wait` | No-op. Update `last_signal` only. |
   | `delegate` | See `## Delegation` for the full per-tick procedure. Behavior depends on parent's `awaiting`/`relay_state`: spawn child on first match, no-op while child runs, replay queued responses keyed by `{capture[0]}` once child closes. |

   Full action enum and `next` template syntax: [references/playbook-format.md](./references/playbook-format.md#action-vocabulary).

   **If the closed worker has `delegate_parent` set in state.json**, after running its own Step 6 close, also: read its review file's `delegate_relay_section` (per the parent's stored value), parse `<N>. <text>` lines into a map, and write that map to the parent's `relay_queue`. Set parent's `relay_state: "queued"`, clear parent's `awaiting`. The relay itself happens on the parent's NEXT tick when its watch rule matches again.

5. If no `watch` pattern matched, run `scripts/detect-state.sh --stdin` against the captured text for a generic signal (`executing` / `idle` / `error` / etc.). Log but don't act on generic signals — the playbook's rules are authoritative.
6. Append a `history` entry to the worker (`{ts, signal, action}`).
7. Update `state.json` atomically (`.tmp` + `mv`).

After processing all workers:
- If any worker had `task_complete` action → proceed to Step 6 for those.
- If all workers are `task_complete` or `dead` → print summary, exit.
- If user invoked `/orca status` → print one line per worker (id, signal, last-poll age) and exit.
- Otherwise → schedule next tick:
  - In `/loop` mode: `ScheduleWakeup` with delay = playbook's `poll_interval_s` (default 90s active, 1200–1800s if every worker is `idle`).
  - Outside `/loop`: print "next poll in {N}s" and exit. User re-invokes manually or via cron.

### Step 6. Close worker(s)

**Two-phase ordering** when multiple workers are queued (e.g. several review-class workers all hit `REVIEW_DONE` in the same tick):

- **Phase 1 (per-worker)**: substeps 1–4 — capture pane, close pane, remove from state if appropriate, offer review chain. Run for every queued worker.
- **Phase 2 (per-cwd, ONCE)**: substep 5 — aggregate review chain, then batch-remove. Runs only after Phase 1 has finished for every worker in the queue.

This ordering matters because aggregation in substep 5 may batch-remove sibling review workers that haven't yet had their pane captured/closed. Always close panes first, aggregate last.

For each worker to close (Phase 1):

1. Capture last 100 lines to `.orca/logs/<worker_id>-<ts>.txt` (preserve evidence).
2. Close the pane:
   - **cmux**: `cmux close-surface --surface <ref>` (add `--window <window>` if the worker is in a separate workspace).
   - **tmux**: `tmux kill-window -t <worker_id>`.
3. Remove the worker entry from `state.json.workers` — UNLESS the worker has `category: review`. **Review-class workers stay in state with `last_signal: task_complete`** until Phase 2's batch-removal. This preserves their `spawned_at` for the aggregation marker so artifacts from earlier-closed siblings aren't missed. (Mark `last_signal: dead` if recovery is plausible for non-review workers — playbook-specific.)
4. **Trigger review chain** (only when `last_signal: task_complete` AND closed worker's `category == "implementation"`):
   - Use the closed worker's `cwd` (persisted at spawn — see Step 4b#11) as the canonical worktree identifier. This works regardless of which param name the playbook used (`repo`, `worktree`, `target`, …).
   - Check whether any review-class workers (`category: review`) with the same `cwd` are already in `state.json.workers[]` or have written to `.orca/reviews/` since this worker's `spawned_at`. If yes, skip — review chain is already in flight or done.
   - **If the closed playbook declares a `chain:` field** (see `references/playbook-format.md` `## Chain`), auto-spawn each listed playbook with NO user prompt. For each chained playbook:
     - Pass the closed worker's `cwd` as the chained playbook's `worktree` (or first dir-pointing param it declares — `worktree` / `repo` / `cwd`).
     - Match other declared params by name from the parent's invocation params (e.g., parent's `app_url` → chained's `app_url`).
     - If a chained playbook declares a required param that can't be resolved, escalate to user and do NOT half-spawn — atomic chain, all-or-nothing.
     - Spawn each through Step 4b. Multiple chained playbooks spawn in the same tick (parallel).
   - **Otherwise** (no `chain:` field), surface the manual offer to the user with concrete invocations:

     > "{playbook} closed cleanly. Want me to spawn validators against {cwd}?"
     > `/orca code-review worktree={cwd} target=<PR# or commit-range>`
     > `/orca ui-validator worktree={cwd} app_url=<url>`

     Wait for confirmation before spawning. See `## Review chain` section below for the full pattern (parallel spawn, frontmatter aggregation, actionable-items handoff).
After Phase 1 finishes for every worker in the close queue, do Phase 2 once per affected `cwd`:

5. **Aggregate review chain** (only when at least one closed worker had `category == "review"`):
   - Look for sibling review-class workers (same `cwd`) in `state.json.workers[]`. **Closed-but-not-removed siblings (per substep 3) count as still-present.** If any have `last_signal != task_complete`, defer aggregation — wait for them to close on a future tick.
   - When all review-class workers for the same `cwd` are `task_complete`, run the aggregation procedure from `## Review chain`. The aggregation snippet reads `spawned_at` from the (still-present) review workers in state.json, so all sibling timestamps are available — no stashing needed.
   - After aggregation completes, **batch-remove** every `task_complete` review-class worker for that `cwd` from `state.json.workers[]`. By Phase 1's contract their panes are already closed, so removal is safe.
6. If `state.json.workers` is empty and `/orca kill` was invoked, optionally archive `state.json` to `.orca/state.<ts>.json.bak` and start fresh on next invocation.

## Polling cadence

- Active mode (any worker not `task_complete`/`dead`): **60–120s** between ticks. Default `poll_interval_s: 90`.
- Idle mode (every worker `idle` for ≥ `idle_threshold_s`): **1200–1800s**. The 5-min cache window matters here — never pick 300–600s, that's worst-of-both.
- Use `ScheduleWakeup` from `/loop` dynamic mode for self-pacing across context boundaries.

## State Files

`.orca/` lives in cwd where `/orca` was invoked. Schemas in [references/state-schema.md](./references/state-schema.md).

```
.orca/
├── state.json           # active workers, backend, last-poll timestamps, params
├── log.md               # append-only chronological session log (cross-session memory)
├── prd-{name}.md        # per-workstream requirements, used to answer worker questions
├── playbooks/           # project-local playbooks (override bundled/global)
├── reviews/             # review-class playbook output (code-review, ui-validator, …)
└── logs/{pane}-{ts}.txt # captured pane output on escalation
```

### Session log (`.orca/log.md`)

`state.json` only holds the *current* state — once a worker is removed, only its `completed_workers` entry survives, and that's terse. The orchestrator's reasoning, decisions, friction patterns, and cross-worker context are lost across sessions unless captured.

Maintain `.orca/log.md` as an **append-only** human-readable timeline. On every session, the orchestrator should:

1. **First invocation of a session** — append a `## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line session theme>` header.
2. **On every meaningful event** — append a row or bullet under the current session:
   - Worker spawned: `| HH:MM | spawn | <worker_id> | <surface> | <one-line scope> |`
   - Worker closed: include outcome + commits landed
   - Decision made (e.g. "skipped chain", "split into N parallel", "committed worker's uncommitted diff")
   - Friction noted (e.g. "worker forgot to commit", "test endpoint kept 500-ing")
3. **At session end / handoff** — write a "Net result" paragraph naming what shipped and what's open.

Why log instead of just relying on `state.json`:
- `state.json.completed_workers` is a flat list of facts; `log.md` captures *why* and *what changed in approach*.
- A new orchestrator session reading `.orca/log.md` can pick up exactly where the previous one left off, including friction patterns to avoid.
- The user can audit a session post-hoc without scrolling pane logs.

Format guidance: keep entries terse (1 line each where possible). A table per session is fine when there are >3 workers. Include git SHAs for every shipped commit.

The log survives `/orca kill` — it is NEVER cleared. Only the user manually removes it.

## Review chain

A **review-class playbook** is one whose output is a structured findings file, not a code change. Bundled examples: `code-review`, `ui-validator`. Future: `security-review`, `perf-review`, `accessibility-review`. They all follow the same convention — see [references/review-format.md](./references/review-format.md).

### When to invoke

After an **implementation playbook** (anything that ends in `task_complete` because real work shipped — `gsd`, custom feature playbooks, …) closes its workers, the orchestrator triggers the review chain. Two paths:

- **Declarative** (preferred for known-thorough flows): the implementation playbook declares a `chain:` list in its frontmatter (see `references/playbook-format.md` `## Chain`). Orca auto-spawns those playbooks on `task_complete` — no user prompt. This is how `gsd-verify.md` differs from `gsd.md`: same body, but `gsd-verify` declares `chain: [code-review, ui-validator]`.
- **Manual** (default for playbooks without `chain:`): orca offers the spawn:

  > "{playbook} finished. Want me to spawn code-review and ui-validator against {worktree}?"

  Validators consume codex/Claude budget and a few minutes of wall time. For unannotated playbooks, default to opt-in so the user picks when the cost is worth it.

### Spawning multiple validators in parallel

review-class playbooks don't depend on each other. Spawn them in the same tick:

```bash
# Each invocation goes through Step 4b independently
/orca code-review worktree=<path> target=<PR# or commit-range> [prd=<path>]
/orca ui-validator worktree=<path> app_url=<url> [target=<feature>] [acceptance_criteria=<path-or-text>]
```

Both end up in `state.json.workers[]` as separate entries. They run side-by-side in their own panes, write to `.orca/reviews/`, and close themselves via their `stop_when` rules.

### Aggregation (after validators close)

Aggregation runs from **Step 6 Phase 2** — after Phase 1 has captured and closed every queued worker's pane for the current tick. Do NOT aggregate during an individual worker's Phase 1 close: that recreates the same-tick race where a sibling's state entry vanishes before its pane is captured. The trigger is "Phase 1 for this tick is finished AND at least one closed worker had `category: review`," not "a single review worker just closed."

1. Find all review files written since the earliest review worker's `spawned_at`. Review-class workers are kept in state.json with `last_signal: task_complete` until this aggregation runs (see Step 6 substep 3) — so the closing worker AND any earlier-closed siblings are all readable here.

   ```bash
   # All task_complete review workers for this cwd are still in state. Find the earliest spawned_at.
   earliest_spawned_at=$(jq -r --arg cwd "$CWD" \
     '.workers[] | select(.category=="review" and .cwd==$cwd) | .spawned_at' \
     .orca/state.json | sort | head -1)

   # Convert ISO8601 UTC → epoch seconds (portable across BSD/GNU date)
   if epoch=$(date -j -u -f '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' "$earliest_spawned_at" +%s 2>/dev/null); then : ;  # macOS BSD date
   else epoch=$(date -u -d "$earliest_spawned_at" +%s); fi                                            # GNU date

   # Create a marker file with that mtime, glob via -newer (POSIX, no date-parse needed in find)
   marker=$(mktemp)
   if [[ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]]; then
     touch -t "$(date -r "$epoch" +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S)" "$marker"     # BSD touch
   else
     touch -d "@$epoch" "$marker"                                # GNU touch
   fi
   find .orca/reviews -type f -name "*.md" -newer "$marker"
   rm "$marker"
   ```

   Why a marker file instead of `find -newermt "$ts"`: BSD `find` rejects ISO8601 with `Z` ("Can't parse date/time"), and BSD vs GNU silently disagree on whether `T`-without-`Z` is UTC or local. Marker mtime is unambiguous on both platforms.
2. For each file, read **frontmatter only** (skip the body for triage):
   ```bash
   awk '/^---$/{c++; next} c==1{print} c==2{exit}' <file>
   ```
   Capture: `type`, `status`, `issue_count`, `target`.
3. Build the user-facing summary:
   ```
   Review chain results:
   - code-review: <status> (<issue_count> issues) — target <target>
   - ui-validation: <status> (<issue_count> issues) — target <target>
   ```
4. If any `status` is `fail` or `needs-attention`, read those files' **`## Actionable items for next agent`** sections (the orchestrator's primary handoff target) and present them to the user with options:
   - **Forward to a fix run**: `/orca gsd repo=<...> phase=fix` (or whatever implementation playbook is appropriate), passing the actionable items as the brief.
   - **Send to specific live worker panes**: if any other workers are still in `state.json.workers[]`, `cmux send --surface <ref>` the relevant items per pane. (Manual in v1 — no `dispatch_to <worker>` action exists yet.)
   - **Stop here**: user reads, decides what to do offline.
5. If every `status` is `pass`, report clean and stop.

### When to stop iterating

A "fix → re-validate → fix again" loop is useful but can run forever finding smaller and smaller nits. Stop the chain when ANY of these are true:

1. **Run reports `status: pass`** — no actionable items. Ship.
2. **Two consecutive runs find only `medium` / `low` issues** (zero `high` / `critical` across both runs). The pattern is doc nits, not functional bugs. Stop, add the remaining items to a project backlog, ship.
3. **Three iterations on the same target** — hard cap. Beyond this, diminishing returns dominate; the cost of another full validator pass exceeds the marginal value. Triage what's left manually.

When stopping for reasons 2 or 3, surface the remaining items to the user explicitly (e.g. "stopping iteration — 2 medium-severity items not addressed: [list]. Add to backlog or ship as-is?"). Never silently drop findings.

The validator briefs already tell codex/claude not to manufacture nits ("if the diff is genuinely clean, `status: pass` and `issue_count: 0`"), but the orchestrator is the final gate — even a strict reviewer can't avoid finding *something* worth mentioning on every pass.

### What NOT to do

- **Don't** rewrite review files. They're append-only artifacts of the review run.
- **Don't** auto-chain into a fix playbook without confirmation. Findings could be wrong, the user should triage.
- **Don't** delete `.orca/reviews/` on `/orca kill`. They survive the session — `kill` only closes panes and clears `state.json.workers[]`.
- **Don't** treat a missing review file as success. If a validator closed without writing one, that's a `dead`/`error` signal, not pass.
- **Don't** keep iterating past the convergence rules above just because the validator is willing to. Token budget and wall time matter.

## Delegation

The `delegate` watch action lets a parent worker offload a question/checkpoint to a child playbook *mid-flow*, then relay the child's answer back into the parent's pane via `send_text`. Use case: GSD's `/gsd:verify-work` runs a series of `CHECKPOINT: Verification Required` prompts; orca delegates each to ui-validator, which exercises the test in a real browser and writes structured responses. Parent never blocks on a human.

See `references/playbook-format.md` `## Delegate action` for syntax.

### Lifecycle

A worker spawned by a `delegate`-action match is called a **delegate child**. It's a normal playbook spawn (Step 4b) but tagged with `delegate_parent: <parent_worker_id>` in `state.json` so orca can route results back later.

State fields added on the parent at first match:

```json
{
  "worker_id": "gsd-uat-01",
  "awaiting": "ui-val-02",          // the delegate child's worker_id
  "delegate_relay_section": "## UAT Responses",  // copied from watch rule
  "relay_queue": null,              // populated when child closes
  "relay_state": "awaiting"         // "awaiting" | "queued" | "drained"
}
```

### Procedure (per tick)

When evaluating watch rules for a worker:

1. **First match of a `delegate` rule** (parent's `awaiting` is null):
   - Substitute `delegate.with` params (incl. `{capture[N]}`, `{cwd}`, etc.).
   - Spawn the child via Step 4b. Child's `delegate_parent` in state.json points back to this worker.
   - Set parent's `awaiting: <child_worker_id>`, `delegate_relay_section`, `relay_state: "awaiting"`.
   - Do NOT send anything to parent's pane this tick.
   - Skip remaining watch rules for the parent this tick.

2. **Match while parent's `awaiting` is set AND `relay_state == "awaiting"`** (child still running):
   - No-op for this rule. Don't re-spawn, don't relay.
   - Other watch rules that don't conflict (e.g., `send_enter` for editor prompts) MAY still fire — order in `watch:` decides.

3. **Child closes** (handled in Step 6 close logic, not here):
   - Read child's review file at `.orca/reviews/<child_review>.md`.
   - Parse the `delegate_relay_section` from the body. Each line in the format `<N>. <text>` becomes a queue entry keyed by `<N>`.
   - Set parent's `relay_queue` to the parsed map (`{1: "pass", 2: "issue: ...", ...}`).
   - Set `relay_state: "queued"`, clear `awaiting`.
   - Child's worker entry follows normal Step 6 close (review-class workers stay until aggregation; non-review children are removed).

4. **Match while `relay_state == "queued"` and queue non-empty**:
   - Use the rule's pattern's first capture group (`{capture[0]}`) as the lookup key.
   - If `relay_queue[key]` exists: `send_text` that response to the parent's pane. Remove that key from the queue.
   - If queue becomes empty: `relay_state: "drained"`.
   - If key NOT in queue: log to `.orca/logs/<parent_id>-relay-miss.txt`, `escalate` to user (the validator missed a test).

5. **Match while `relay_state == "drained"`**: fall through to next watch rule. The delegate is exhausted — user can re-trigger by manually invoking the same action or letting another rule handle the prompt.

### Idle suppression

While `awaiting != null`, the parent's idle threshold is suspended. Don't mark `last_signal: idle` or escalate; the child is doing real work and the parent's pane intentionally shows no progress.

Once `awaiting` clears (relay_state queued or drained), normal idle rules resume.

### Convention for child playbooks

Children invoked via `delegate` MUST write a `<relay_section>` (default `## Responses`) to their review file with one line per response in the format `<N>. <text>`. Anything else is informational (the rest of the review still gets aggregated).

ui-validator's UAT mode (criteria points to a `*-UAT.md`) is the canonical example — see `playbooks/ui-validator.md` `## UAT mode`.

### Limitations (v1)

- One delegate child at a time per parent. A second `delegate` match while `awaiting` is set is a no-op.
- No timeout on `awaiting` — if child hangs, parent stays paused indefinitely. Manual `/orca kill <child_id>` clears it (orca should detect orphaned `awaiting` on next tick and unset).
- Queue is exhausted in match-by-key order, not insertion order. Multiple matches with the same `{capture[0]}` would only fire once per key.
- Children of children (delegate chains) are not supported. A delegate child's playbook MUST NOT itself contain `delegate` watch rules.

## Helper Scripts

```bash
~/.claude/skills/orca/scripts/poll.sh              # per worker: signal-channel summary, else capture+classify pane
~/.claude/skills/orca/scripts/detect-state.sh PANE # classify one pane against playbook patterns (screen-scrape fallback)
~/.claude/skills/orca/scripts/read-signal.sh ID    # orchestrator: latest event + heartbeat age for a worker
~/.claude/skills/orca/scripts/orca-signal EVENT    # worker: emit an event to the signal channel (needs $ORCA_SIGNAL_FILE)
```

These call the backend-appropriate primitive based on `.orca/state.json`'s `backend` field.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Write project code from orca | Spawn a worker, delegate |
| Launch omp/claude in a lowered-approval mode that prompts mid-run | Unattended launcher every time; omp defaults to `yolo`; `cdp` / codex-bypass for the others |
| Hardcode workflow logic into orca | Put it in a playbook |
| Hardcode tmux or cmux commands | Use the backend abstraction in `references/backends.md` |
| Poll faster than 60s in active mode | Sub-60s burns compute for no benefit |
| Forget to capture `cmux new-split` stdout | The new `surface:N` is in the OK line — parse it; don't re-list |
| Forget `--window` for cross-window cmux workspaces | Splits don't need it; separate workspaces do |
| Auto-close panes you didn't spawn | Only kill panes tracked in `.orca/state.json` |
| Screen-scrape a worker that has a `signal_file` | Read structured events via `read-signal.sh`; `watch[]` is fallback only |
| Rely on a banner string (`PHASE N COMPLETE ✓`) for completion | Have the worker emit `orca-signal done` / `phase_complete`; match with `events[]` |
| Assume a quiet pane means progress | Watchdog on `heartbeat_age_s` > `stuck_threshold_s` → escalate |

## Voice mode (`/orca --voice`)

Optional. Wraps the orca pane with bidirectional voice I/O so you can listen to orca's responses and reply by talking. Workers stay text-only — voice only speaks/types **for the orca pane itself**, since orca already narrates whatever its workers are doing.

**Architecture in one paragraph.** The talk-to-claude project at `~/Code/talk-to-claude/` ships a small HTTP daemon that owns TTS, recording, transcription, and key injection. A user-global Claude Code Stop hook (`~/.claude/settings.json`) POSTs to that daemon on every Claude turn; the daemon checks whether the firing session's `$CMUX_SURFACE_ID` matches the orca pane that registered itself, and only speaks for matches. A Raycast hotkey POSTs to `/talk` to record a turn (sox VAD → Whisper → `cmux send` into the orca pane).

### Requirements

| Need | Why |
|------|-----|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var | Whisper transcription |
| `sox`, `curl`, `python3` | Recording, HTTP, JSON |
| `~/.local/bin/say` (kokoro wrapper) **or** override `TTC_SAY` | TTS playback |
| Raycast Script Command directory pointing at `~/Code/talk-to-claude/raycast-scripts/` | Hotkey for push-to-talk |
| Stop hook installed in `~/.claude/settings.json` (one-time) | Forwards turn-end events to the daemon |

### Handler procedure (when `--voice` appears in args)

1. **Verify cmux** — voice mode requires `$CMUX_SURFACE_ID` to be set. If empty (e.g., running under tmux or bare terminal), abort with: "🐋 voice mode requires cmux." Do NOT proceed to start the daemon.
2. **Branch on subcommand**:
   - `--voice off` → `curl -sf -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8848/unregister` ; report "🐋 voice off (daemon kept running)" ; strip flag and continue routing.
   - `--voice` or `--voice on` (default) → continue to step 3.
3. **Start the daemon if not running** —
   ```bash
   if ! curl -sf --max-time 0.5 http://127.0.0.1:8848/health >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     # IMPORTANT: do NOT nohup/disown. cmux's socket auth uses the caller's
     # process ancestry — if the daemon detaches and reparents to launchd,
     # `cmux send` from inside the daemon fails silently (rc != 0, empty
     # stderr). Keep it as a backgrounded child of this shell so the cmux
     # ancestor chain is preserved.
     mkdir -p /tmp/talk-to-claude
     python3 "$HOME/Code/talk-to-claude/voice-daemon.py" \
       >>/tmp/talk-to-claude/daemon.stdout 2>&1 &
     for _ in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
       sleep 0.25
       curl -sf --max-time 0.5 http://127.0.0.1:8848/health >/dev/null 2>&1 && break
     done
   fi
   ```
4. **Register the orca pane** —
   ```bash
   curl -sf -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8848/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"surface_id\":\"$CMUX_SURFACE_ID\",\"workspace_id\":\"$CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID\"}"
   ```
5. **Confirm to the user** with a one-liner that includes the registered surface and the hotkey hint, e.g.:
   "🎙 voice on (surface:NN). Press your Raycast hotkey to talk; orca's replies will be spoken."
6. **Strip `--voice` from args** and continue routing per [Step 3](#step-3-route-by-user-input). `/orca --voice` alone falls through to planning (Step 4a); `/orca --voice gsd phase=2` continues to Step 4b.

### Daemon endpoints (for diagnostics)

| Endpoint | Use |
|----------|-----|
| `GET /health` | "ok" if up |
| `GET /status` | JSON snapshot — registered surface, last assistant text, etc. |
| `POST /register` `{surface_id, workspace_id}` | Claim TTS/PTT for that pane |
| `POST /unregister` | Release the pane |
| `POST /stop` | Internal — wired from Claude Code Stop hook |
| `POST /talk` | Internal — wired from Raycast PTT hotkey |
| `POST /silence` | Kill in-flight TTS |

### Gotchas

- The daemon survives orca exits on purpose (so `/orca --voice off` then `/orca --voice` later is cheap). To fully kill it: `pkill -f voice-daemon.py`.
- The Stop hook is global, so any Claude session can register itself in principle — but only the registered surface will be served. Workers' Stop hooks no-op silently.
- Whisper occasionally hallucinates "you" / "thank you" on near-silence; the daemon already filters those.
- `cmux send` types literal characters and submits with Enter. If you want to dictate something multi-line, do it in two presses (orca's prompt buffer accepts the second message as a continuation).
